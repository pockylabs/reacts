# React by Meta

## Goals of React Basics
* Develop familiarity with the React.js library
* Explore state and state-management
* Navigation and assets in React.js
* Styling React apps
* Event Handling

### State
The values of all variables your app is working with at any given point

### Component-based Architecture
Build software based on reusable components of code <br>
Reusable means used multiple times and easily inserted anywhere where we needed <br>
Independent means components can exist within the same space independently from each other.

### Components
Stand alone parts of a UI

### Functional Components
```
function Welcome() {
    return <h1>"Hello"</h1>
};
```

### Class Components
```
class Welcome extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <h1>"Hello"</h1>
    };
};
```

### Transpiling
interpreting a programming language and translating it to a specific target language. (process of converting jsx to HTML).
